# Nostos OS

Welcome to the Nostos OS GitHub organization! Nostos OS is a minimalist operating system designed specifically for running classic games like Tetris and Space Invaders. Our mission is to provide a lightweight, dedicated gaming environment that captures the nostalgia of retro gaming.

## Features

1. Minimalist Design: Nostos OS is built from scratch, focusing solely on loading and running classic games.
2. Custom Kernel: A simple, efficient kernel that manages memory, processes, and basic I/O.
3. Game Loader: A straightforward game loader that allows users to select and play games.
4. Basic Drivers: Essential drivers for keyboard input, audio, display output, and timer interrupts.
5. User Interface: A minimal UI that provides an easy-to-use menu for selecting and launching games.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
1. A development environment with a cross-compiler for building the OS.
